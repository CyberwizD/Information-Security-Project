# Information-Security
This repository contains my solutions and projects from the Information Security course by freeCodeCamp. The course is a part of freeCodeCamp's curriculum designed to provide a solid foundation in building secure web apps using HelmetJS with tools/scripts in Python, focusing on practical applications of good information security. Throughout the course, I have completed several projects that demonstrate key skills in helmetJS, python, problem-solving, and data manipulation
